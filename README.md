# Our Journey Begins... and Now, We Share It.

For years, our love story unfolded quietly, a cherished bond known to our immediate families and, most importantly, to the two of us. Today, with full hearts, we are thrilled to share it more widely with the world.

It all started in middle school around 2011, where Laurensius Jeffrey Chandra (Skiddle) and Jacqueline Patravee (Scarletnine) first met. Though high school took us on different paths, our connection remained, and on April 14, 2014, we took the step to build something serious together.

While our families have known and supported us for years, over the next decade, our relationship remained our private sanctuary from a broader circle. It never appeared on social media, and for a long time, many friends didn't know. This choice began for simple, perhaps even foolish, reasons, but over the years, as we both became involved in the Privacy Movement, our shared commitment to carefully curating our digital lives only deepened this approach. Within that privacy, however, our bond deepened and strengthened. We navigated the challenges of long-distance, including a stretch of 5 years without meeting face-to-face. It was during these times, and through every moment, that trust became the unwavering foundation of our relationship – a trust that has always been mutual and absolute, leaving no room for jealousy.

Beyond the distance, we built a life together in shared moments: traveling, playing games side-by-side, and supporting each other's passions and hobbies. These experiences, big and small, wove the tapestry of our connection.

Now, after 10 years of shared moments, growth, and unwavering love, we are ready to take the next step publicly. On August 4, 2024, a date already special as Jacqueline's birthday (and just 5 days before Jeff's – happy Leos! 🦁), Laurensius proposed, and we got engaged!

It feels incredible to finally share this joy with all of you. While we cherish the privacy that allowed our love to flourish away from the noise, we are excited to no longer deny our relationship and to celebrate our future openly. Moving forward, we will continue to carefully curate what we share digitally, maintaining a balance between sharing our happiness and safeguarding our personal space.
